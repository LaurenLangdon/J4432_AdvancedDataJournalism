The repository that I decided to clone is playgrounds2 by the NPR visuals team. I thought this repository was interesting because the description says that it is a “community-edited guide to accessible playgrounds in the United States.” In the README file it says that this application is connected to Google Docs, which I thought was a great way for people who don’t know code to contribute to this project. Since this is a complicated repository there were some phrases that I didn’t know like S3, EC2, cron jobs, cron fails, etc. The python documents were surprisingly easy to read, and I learned that the app has python coding showing how to access information from the Google Sheet and where to import data from.
